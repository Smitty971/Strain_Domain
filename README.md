# Strain_Domain

Built for Flatiron School as a Module 4 JS-Rails Project. This is a SPA(Single Page Application) It consists of a Rails API Backend to handle data and a Vanilla JavaScript Frontend for the UI.

Strain_Domain is for those who are currently on a medical marijuana treatment plan. Strain_Domain helps the user to keep track of cannabis strains that work and don't work for that particular user.

Strain//Domain is for medical and research purposes. Not for illicit or illegal activity. Please check your state or country's marijuana laws.

Consult Your Health Care Professional before starting a medical marijuana treatment plan.
